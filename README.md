# heart-disease-prediction


## Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains patient information such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health factors.

## Dataset
- **Source**: `heart.csv`
- **Features**: Various health indicators
- **Target Variable**: Presence of heart disease

## Methodology
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Identified **data distributions and outliers**
- Built **predictive models** using **logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests**
- Evaluated **model accuracy and performance metrics**

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Power BI, Tableau** (for visualizations)
- **Machine Learning Models**
- **Apache Kafka & Flink** (for real-time event processing)

## Results
- Achieved high prediction accuracy
- Identified key risk factors contributing to heart disease
- Built an interactive dashboard for insights
